                <h2>Improvised Sofa Cushion with Open Shelving made of  Mulawin Wood and Plastic Wastes</h2>
                <p>Having a reading space in schools is essential for enhancing students' literacy, vocabulary, imagination, and creativity. However, not all schools can afford large reading areas. The "Improvised Sofa Cushion with Open Shelving" project addresses this challenge by using sustainable materials like durable Mulawin wood and plastic waste. The sofa is designed for comfort in small spaces, with built-in shelving for book storage, promoting neatness and convenience. Using recycled plastic reduces costs, supports environmental conservation, and repurposes household waste, making the project cost-effective and eco-friendly. </p>
