About the Project
To accomplish this project, we used the programming languages, HTML and CSS. We used the previous to create and structure the web, format contents, and display it in web browsers. While we used the latter to define the presentation of the web page. We used it to control the layout, design and the responsiveness of the web page to make it functional for the users. The project tackles the creatorsâ€™ background and expertise as well as their chosen SDG which is Life On Land.
